=== Text #38: Augustine - The desire for wisdom ===
Author: Augustine (354-430 AD)
Source: Adapted from his book ON FREE CHOICE OF THE WILL (De libero arbitrio), Part 2.
Passage:
Just as it is agreed that we all wish to be happy, so too it is agreed that we all wish to be wise, because who is happy without wisdom? Because nobody is satisfied without the supreme good which is discovered and possessed in the truth which we call wisdom. Even before we are happy, the idea of happiness is impressed on our mind. This is how we know, and can assert confidently and with no doubt whatsoever, that we wish to be happy. Similarly, even before we are wise, the notion of wisdom is stamped on our mind. That is why each of us, if asked whether he wants to be wise, replies without a shadow of doubt that he does. ... Because if your mind was not somehow aware of what wisdom is, you would never know that you desire to be wise, or that you should desire to be wise - and neither of them, I think, you will deny.

=== Text #37: Søren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity is Truth ===
Author: Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)
Source: Danish philosopher, father of existentialism. His central question is: What does it mean to live authentically?
Passage:
Only knowledge that relates to existence is essential knowledge. Subjective thinking is thinking which has a relation to the existence of the thinker. Objective thinking is thinking which has no relation to the existence of the thinker, or abstractly relates to existence in general. The objective thinker is indifferent to the existing subjectivity, and therefore to his own existence. The subjectively existing thinker, on the contrary, is infinitely interested in his own existence.

=== Text #36: Francis Herbert Bradley - Harmony in the absolute ===
Author: Francis Herbert Bradley (1846-1924)
Source: From his book APPEARANCE AND REALITY (1893).
Passage:
We can find no province of the world so low that the Absolute does not inhabit it. Nowhere is there even a single fact so fragmentary and so poor that it does not matter to the universe. There is truth in every idea however false, there is reality in every existence however slight; and where we can point to reality or truth, there is the one undivided life of the Absolute. ... But on the other hand, Reality is not the sum of things. It is the unity in which all things, coming together, are transformed, although not equally. And in this unity, relations of separation and hostility are affirmed and absorbed.

=== Text #35: Simone de Beauvoir - The value of freedom ===
Author: Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986)
Source: In THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY (1947) she argues that although no objective judgement can tell us the objective value of our action, what matters is that we are acting out of our freedom.
Passage:
Regardless of the incredible dimensions of the world around us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes, and our weakness as individuals within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to want our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open to the infinite. And in fact, any person who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he does not need any external guarantee in order to be sure of his goals. His certainty in them comes from his own drive.

=== Text #34: Simone Weil - To accept the void ===
Author: Simone Weil (1909-1943)
Source: From her book GRAVITY AND GRACE (1947).
Passage:
We must accept emptiness instead trying fill it up with imaginary satisfactions... We must not seek being but rather consent not-to-be... To detach ourselves from imaginary goods so real good may come... To wait patiently inactive while time passes leaving us empty until real inspiration comes... All sins are attempts fill voids... Each void presents itself as need... And every need tends toward its satisfaction unless we stop it voluntarily accepting void instead satisfaction thus transforming need into desire for absolute good which cannot be satisfied by anything finite but only by infinite reality itself namely God who alone can fill infinite abyss within human soul created for Him alone.

=== Text #33: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel - The dialectical movement of spirit ===
Author: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831)
Source: The following is from his LECTURES ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY (1837).
Passage:
Just as the essence of matter is gravity, so, in contrast, we may affirm that the essence of Spirit is Freedom. Everybody will easily agree that Spirit also has, among other properties, Freedom; but philosophy teaches that all the qualities of Spirit exist only through Freedom; that all these qualities are only means for attaining Freedom; that all of them seek and produce this and only this. It is a result of speculative philosophy that freedom is the only truth of Spirit. Matter possesses gravity because of its tendency toward a central point. It is essentially composite - consisting of parts that exclude each other. Spirit, in contrast, may be defined as that which has its center in itself.

=== Text #32: Johann Gottlieb Fichte - The voice of conscience ===
Author: Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814)
Source: From his book THE VOCATION OF MAN (1800).
Passage:
Conscience never errs nor can err because it consists simply in being conscious that we have applied our moral principle correctly... Conscience commands absolutely without any condition... Its voice speaks immediately within me when I reflect upon my duty... I cannot evade its decision nor seek any external justification... I must obey unconditionally even if all sensible beings were against me... This voice alone gives me true self-sufficiency because through it I become independent from everything outside myself including other people's opinions... Through conscience I become free because I follow only my own law which I give myself through reason.

=== Text #31: Boethius of Dacia - The pursuit of wisdom ===
Author: Boethius of Dacia (c.1240-c.1290)
Source: From his book ON THE SUPREME GOOD (c.1270).
Passage:
The supreme good for man consists in knowing God through wisdom; because through wisdom we know everything knowable about God insofar as it can be known by human reason illuminated by faith; and through this knowledge we are united with God who alone can satisfy our will completely since He alone possesses infinite goodness capable of satisfying infinitely our capacity for good which was created for Him alone... Therefore let us pursue wisdom above all else because through it we attain our ultimate end which consists entirely in knowing God who alone can make us happy eternally.

=== Text #30: Jean-Jacques Rousseau - Virtue, freedom, love ===
Author: Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
Source: From his book EMILE (1762).
Passage:
The first impulses of nature are always right; there is no original sin in the human heart; every vice can be traced to its beginning step by step. ... The only passion natural to man is self-love-or selfishness taken in an extended sense. This selfishness considered relative to ourselves is good and useful; and since it has no necessary relation to others it becomes indifferent by nature: It becomes good or bad only by application and according to circumstances. ... Until reason's guide appears children should do nothing except by physical necessity: They should never obey someone else's will nor command others' will themselves.

=== Text #29: Aldous Huxley - The self as an island ===
Author: Aldous Huxley (1894-1963)
Source: From his book THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY (1945).
Passage:
We live in succession-in division-in parts-in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty-to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us-is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour-but also active like light-passing through us as if we were transparent-and making us see all things in its rays; a light which shines through us upon things and makes them beautiful. ... We are like islands in the sea-separate on the surface but connected in the deep.
