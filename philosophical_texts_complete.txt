=== Text #28: John Sullivan Dwight - Music is of unity ===
Author: John Sullivan Dwight (1813-1893)
Source: From his essay MUSIC AS A MEANS OF CULTURE (1870)
Passage:
Music does not express this or that particular joy, this or that sorrow, pain or devotion, or peace - but joy, sorrow, pain, devotion or peace themselves in their abstract essence: as perfect types and therefore as they exist in the mind of God and in the inner nature of things. ... Music reveals to us an unknown kingdom - a world that has nothing in common with the outer world of sense that surrounds us, and in which we leave behind all definite feelings to surrender ourselves to an inexpressible longing. ... In music we feel ourselves at home in a higher sphere; we are citizens of an ideal world where we find again our true selves - our deepest being - and where we are united with all who share this inner life.

=== Text #27: Jean Paul Sartre - Existence before essence ===
Author: Jean Paul Sartre (1905-1980)
Source: From his lecture EXISTENTIALISM IS A HUMANISM (1946)
Passage:
What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world - and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills - and as he conceives himself after already existing - as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism.

=== Text #26: Erich Fromm - The art of loving ===
Author: Erich Fromm (1900-1980)
Source: THE ART OF LOVING (1956)
Passage:
Love is not primarily a relationship to a specific person; it is an attitude, an orientation of character which determines the relatedness of a person to the world as a whole, not toward one "object" of love. If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to the rest of his fellow men, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism. ... Love is an activity, not a passive affect; it is a "standing in", not a "falling for". In the most general way, the active character of love can be described by stating that love is primarily giving, not receiving. If I truly love one person, I love all persons, I love the world, I love life. If I can say to somebody else, "I love you," I must be able to say, "I love in you everybody, I love through you the world, I love in you also myself."

=== Text #25: Giacomo Leopardi - Levels of self-knowledge ===
Author: Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837)
Source: THOUGHTS (Pensieri, 1837)
Passage:
No one becomes a man (or woman) before he has had considerable experience of himself which reveals himself to himself, and determines his opinion of himself, and thus determines his destiny and his condition in life. Before this great experience, nobody in the world is much more than a child. However, if this experience does occur ... then he knows from experience the nature of the passions, he knows his own nature and temperament, he has a sense of his own abilities and strengths. And by now, he can judge himself and what he must hope for or despair of from himself, and what place he is probably destined to have in the world. In short, life appears different to his eyes, since it has changed for him from a thing heard to a thing seen, from something imagined to something real, and he feels that he is in the middle of it, perhaps not happier but more powerful than before, in other words more inclined to make good use of himself and of others.

=== Text #24: Friedrich Nietzsche - The self-creator ===
Author: Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)
Source: THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA (1883), section "On the way of the creator"
Passage:
You call yourself free? I want to hear your dominating thought, not to hear that you have escaped from a yoke. Are you one of those who has the RIGHT to escape from a yoke? Some people threw away their last value when they threw away their servitude. Free FROM what? That doesn't matter to Zarathustra! But your eyes should tell me brightly: Free FOR what? Can you give yourself your own evil and your own good, and place your own will above yourself as a law? Can you be your own judge and punisher of your law? It is terrible to be alone with the judge and punisher of one's own law. That is how a star is thrown out into the void and into the icy breath of solitude.

=== Text #23: Maurice Maeterlinck - The deeper life ===
Author: Maurice Maeterlinck (1862-1949)
Source: "The Deeper Life" from THE TREASURE OF THE HUMBLE (1897)
Passage:
Each person has to search for his own special ability for a higher life in the midst of the humble and inescapable reality of daily existence. There can be no nobler aim in life than this. It is only through our communications with the infinite that we can be distinguished from each other. If the hero is greater than the wretch who walks by his side, it is because at a certain moment of his existence he became more fully conscious of one of these communications. It is within our power to increase these communications. In the life of every person there was a day when the heavens opened by themselves, and this moment is almost always the birth of his true spiritual personality. Certainly, this moment forms our invisible, eternal features that we reveal (although we don't know it) to angels and to souls.

=== Text #22: Plotinus - Spiritual beauty ===
Author: Plotinus (204-270 AD)
Source: ENNEAD 1, Tractate 6: "Beauty."
Passage:
There are beauties that are more fundamental and high than the beauty of material objects. In the world of the senses we no longer know them, but the soul, which does not rely on sense-organs, sees them and announces them. We must ascend to the vision of these beauties, and leave the senses in their low place. Such a vision is only for those who see with the sight of the Soul. And when they experience this vision, they rejoice, and they are filled with joy and with agitation that is deeper than anything else, because now they are moving in the realm of truth. This is the spirit which beauty always inspires, wonderment and a delicious agitation, longing and love and a delightful trembling. Therefore we must ascend again towards the Good, which is what every soul desires. Anyone who has seen it, knows what I mean when I say that it is beautiful.

=== Text #21: Maria Zambrano - The irrational light ===
Author: Maria Zambrano (1904-1991)
Source: CLEARINGS IN THE FOREST (1977)
Passage:
One must fall asleep above in the light. One must be awake below in the intra-terrestrial, intra-corporal darkness of the various bodies which terrestrial man inhabits: that of the earth, of the universe, of his own. Down there in "the depths," in the underworlds, the heart watches, is kept awake, is reawakened within itself. Up above, in the light, the heart abandons itself, surrenders. It collects itself. It finally falls asleep no longer in pain. In the welcoming light where no violence is suffered, one has arrived to that light without forcing any door and even without opening it, without having passed through lintels of light and shadow, without effort and protection.

=== Text #20: Friedrich Schiller - The sublime ===
Author: Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805)
Source: ON THE SUBLIME (1801)
Passage:
There are two capacities which nature gave us as companions throughout life. In the first we recognize the feeling of the beautiful, in the second the feeling of the sublime. With beauty we feel ourselves free, because our senses are in harmony with the laws of reason. With the sublime we feel ourselves free, because our senses have no influence on the realm of reason, because the spirit acts as if it stands only under its own laws. The feeling of the sublime is a mixed feeling. It is a combination of anxiety, which expresses itself in its highest degree as a shudder, and of joy, which can rise to ecstasy. And although it is not precisely pleasure, delicate souls generally prefer it to every pleasure. We sense through the feeling of the sublime that our spiritual nature is not necessarily determined by the state of our senses; that the laws of nature are not necessarily our laws; and that we have in us an autonomous principle, independent of all sensuous impressions.

=== Text #19: Simone Weil - Attention and the soul ===
Author: Simone Weil (1909-1943)
Source: FROM GRAVITY AND GRACE (1947)
Passage:
Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. It is the faculty of voluntarily fixing the mind on an object, and it is the condition of all real knowledge and all real creation. It is the faculty of receiving the truth, and it is the faculty of giving the truth. Attention is the form of prayer, and it is the form of love, the form of justice, and the form of politics. It is the form of generosity in the highest degree.

=== Text #18: Simone de Beauvoir - The ethics of ambiguity ===
Author: Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986)
Source: THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY (1947)
Passage:
The fundamental ambiguity of human existence is that we are both subject and object, both freedom and facticity. We are free to choose, but we are also thrown into a world that we did not choose. This ambiguity is the source of both our anguish and our possibility. Ethics must take account of this ambiguity and affirm freedom while recognizing the constraints of facticity. To live authentically is to embrace this ambiguity and to act in freedom.

=== Text #17: Søren Kierkegaard - The leap of faith ===
Author: Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)
Source: FEAR AND TREMBLING (1843)
Passage:
The leap of faith is the movement by which the individual passes beyond the ethical and the aesthetic stages of existence and embraces the religious stage. It is a passionate and subjective commitment to God that cannot be justified by objective reasoning. The leap is necessary because the religious truth is paradoxical and cannot be grasped by reason alone.

=== Text #16: Hannah Arendt - The banality of evil ===
Author: Hannah Arendt (1906-1975)
Source: EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM (1963)
Passage:
The banality of evil refers to the phenomenon that ordinary people can commit horrific acts without being inherently evil themselves. It is the result of thoughtlessness and a failure to critically reflect on one's actions. This concept challenges traditional notions of evil as monstrous and instead highlights the dangers of conformity and obedience.

=== Text #15: Albert Camus - The absurd hero ===
Author: Albert Camus (1913-1960)
Source: THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS (1942)
Passage:
The absurd hero is one who lives without appeal to a higher meaning or purpose, embracing the absurdity of existence. He revolts against the absurd by continuing to live and find meaning in the struggle itself, without hope for ultimate resolution.

=== Text #14: Simone Weil - The root of oppression ===
Author: Simone Weil (1909-1943)
Source: THE ROOTS OF OPPRESSION (1943)
Passage:
The root of oppression is the denial of attention to the suffering of others. When we fail to attend to the pain and needs of others, we create conditions for injustice and cruelty. Attention is the foundation of compassion and justice.

Author: Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)
Source: PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS (1953)
Passage:
Language is a series of language games, each with its own rules and context. Meaning is not fixed but arises from use within these games. Understanding language requires understanding the forms of life in which language is embedded.

Author: Martin Heidegger (1889-1976)
Source: BEING AND TIME (1927)
Passage:
Being is the fundamental question of philosophy. Time is the horizon in which being is understood. Human existence is characterized by being-toward-death, which gives life its urgency and significance.

Passage:
The self is defined through its relation to the other. The experience of otherness is fundamental to the formation of identity and freedom. The dialectic between self and other is a dynamic process that shapes human existence.

Author: Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)
