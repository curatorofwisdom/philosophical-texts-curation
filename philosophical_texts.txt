=== Text #38: Augustine - The desire for wisdom ===
Author: Augustine (354-430 AD)
Title: The desire for wisdom
Tags: Wisdom, Happiness, Desire, Truth, Philosophy
Passage:
Just as it is agreed that we all wish to be happy, so too it is agreed that we all wish to be wise, because who is happy without wisdom? Because nobody is satisfied without the supreme good which is discovered and possessed in the truth which we call wisdom. Even before we are happy, the idea of happiness is impressed on our mind. This is how we know, and can assert confidently and with no doubt whatsoever, that we wish to be happy. Similarly, even before we are wise, the notion of wisdom is stamped on our mind. That is why each of us, if asked whether he wants to be wise, replies without a shadow of doubt that he does. … Because if your mind was not somehow aware of what wisdom is, you would never know that you desire to be wise, or that you should desire to be wise – and neither of them, I think, you will deny.

=== Text #36: Francis Herbert Bradley - Harmony in the absolute ===
Author: Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924)
Title: Harmony in the absolute
Tags: Absolute, Reality, Harmony, Unity, Metaphysics
Passage:
We can find no province of the world so low that the Absolute does not inhabit it. Nowhere is there even a single fact so fragmentary and so poor that it does not matter to the universe. There is truth in every idea however false, there is reality in every existence however slight; and where we can point to reality or truth, there is the one undivided life of the Absolute. […] But on the other hand, Reality is not the sum of things. It is the unity in which all things, coming together, are transformed, although not equally. And in this unity, relations of separation and hostility are affirmed and absorbed. These relations, too, are harmonious in the Whole […] Extreme hostility implies a more intense relation, and this relation is part of the Whole and enriches its unity. The apparent disharmony and disturbance is overruled into harmony, and it is the condition of fuller and more individual development.

=== Text #35: Simone de Beauvoir - The value of freedom ===
Author: Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986)
Title: The value of freedom
Tags: Freedom, Responsibility, Ambiguity, Ethics, Existentialism
Passage:
Regardless of the incredible dimensions of the world around us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes, and our weakness as individuals within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to want our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open to the infinite. And in fact, any person who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he does not need any external guarantee in order to be sure of his goals. His certainty in them comes from his own drive. There is a very old saying which goes: “Do what you must, whatever happens.” … If each person did what he must, existence would be saved in each person without any need to dream about a paradise where everything would be reconciled with death.

=== Text #33: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel - Spirit is freedom ===
Author: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831)
Title: Spirit is freedom
Tags: Spirit, Freedom, Dialectics, Philosophy of History, Hegelianism
Passage:
Just as the essence of matter is gravity, so, in contrast, we may affirm that the essence of Spirit is Freedom. Everybody will easily agree that Spirit also has, among other properties, Freedom; but philosophy teaches that all the qualities of Spirit exist only through Freedom; that all these qualities are only means for attaining Freedom; that all of them seek and produce this and only this. It is a result of speculative philosophy that freedom is the only truth of Spirit. Matter possesses gravity because of its tendency toward a central point. It is essentially composite – consisting of parts that exclude each other. It seeks its unity … Spirit, in contrast, may be defined as that which has its center in itself. It does not have a unity outside itself, but it has already found it; it exists in and with itself. Matter has its essence out of itself; Spirit has self‑contained existence.

=== Text #25: Giacomo Leopardi - Levels of self‑knowledge ===
Author: Giacomo Leopardi (1798–1837)
Title: Levels of self‑knowledge
Tags: Self‑knowledge, Experience, Maturity, Pessimism, Human condition
Passage:
82. *No one becomes a man (or woman) before he has had considerable experience of himself which reveals himself to himself, and determines his opinion of himself, and thus determines his destiny and his condition in life. Before this great experience, nobody in the world is much more than a child…*
*However, if this experience does occur … then he knows from experience the nature of the passions, he knows his own nature and temperament, he has a sense of his own abilities and strengths. And by now, he can judge himself and what he must hope for or despair of from himself, and what place he is probably destined to have in the world.*
*In short, life appears different to his eyes, since it has changed for him from a thing heard to a thing seen, from something imagined to something real, and he feels that he is in the middle of it, perhaps not happier but more powerful than before, in other words more inclined to make good use of himself and of others.*
