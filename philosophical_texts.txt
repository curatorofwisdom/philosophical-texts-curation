=== Text #45: Gabriel Marcel - Myself as a gift ===
Author: Gabriel Marcel (1889-1973)
Title: Myself as a gift
Tags: Gift, Self, Ego, Humility, Responsibility
Passage:
Maybe there is no more fatal error than that which conceives of the ego as the secret home of originality. … The best part of my personality does not belong to me. I am in no sense the owner, only the trustee. … If I consider myself as the guardians of my gifts, responsible for their fruitfulness – that is to say, if I recognize in them a call, or perhaps a question to which I must respond – it will not occur to me to be proud about them, and to parade them before an audience, which (as I said before) really means before myself.
Indeed, if we think about it, there is nothing in me that cannot or should not be regarded as a gift. It is pure fiction to imagine a pre-existent self to whom those gifts were given thanks to certain rights that I have, or as a reward for my previous merits.

=== Text #44: Johann Gottfried Herder - Between two worlds ===
Author: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803)
Title: Between two worlds
Tags: Duality, Spirituality, Human condition, Earth vs spiritual, Immortality
Passage:
The curious inconsistency of the human condition becomes clear: As an animal, the human being tends to the earth, and is attached to it as his dwelling place. As a human being, he has within him the seeds of immortality, which require to be planted in another soil. As an animal, he can satisfy his wants, and people who are content with this feel themselves sufficiently happy here below; but those who seek a nobler purpose find everything around them imperfect and incomplete. What is most noble is never accomplished upon the earth, what is most pure is rarely stable and long-lasting. This arena is only a place of exercise and trial for the powers of our hearts and minds. The history of the human species – including what it has attempted and what has happened to it, the efforts it has made and the revolutions it has undergone – proves this sufficiently.

=== Text #43: Sophie de Condorcet - Noble love ===
Author: Sophie de Condorcet (1764-1822)
Title: Noble love
Tags: Love, Virtue, Friendship, Generosity, Esteem
Passage:
A person who is worthy of esteem is happy to esteem others. His heart is easily moved by the mere thought of a good action, and it is tied and attached to anybody he thinks can perform such an action. He is happy to be with him, and their brotherhood of virtue creates between them freedom and equality, which they may experience tenderly like the tenderness between the closest blood and natural relatives.
[…] It is so true that the pleasure we find in loving comes (at least in the case of friendship), to a large extent, from our pleasure of making people happy through our affections, so that only generous souls can love. Souls that lack magnanimity or nobility, or that have been corrupted by selfishness, might want to be loved and might seek love's delight and fruits, but only generous hearts who can be touched by the happiness of others really know how to love.

=== Text #42: Blaise Pascal - The dignity of thought ===
Author: Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)
Title: The dignity of thought
Tags: Thought, Dignity, Morality, Human nature, Reason
Passage:
Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed. The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him. A vapor, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But, if the universe were to crush him, man would still be more noble than that which killed him, because he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him; the universe knows nothing of this.
All our dignity consists, then, in thought. By it we must elevate ourselves; not by space or time which we cannot fill. Let us endeavor then to think well; this is the principle of morality.
348. A thinking reed: It is not from space that I must seek my dignity but from government over my thought; I shall have no more if I possess worlds; by space universe encompasses me like an atom; by thought I comprehend world.

=== Text #41: Joaquín Xirau Palau - The metaphysics of crisis ===
Author: Joaquín Xirau Palau (1895-1945)
Title: The metaphysics of crisis
Tags: Crisis, Metaphysics, Modernity, Chaos, Cosmos, Spirit
Passage:
The social and political crisis through which the world is passing has a metaphysical background that has been little noticed, or is wholly unknown to the great majority of people. It persists in the air that we breathe; its presence is so familiar that it is imperceptible. …
Modern life is chaos, not Cosmos. As such, it lacks a center, it is meaningless, aimless. The ancient world was an organism. And, as in every organism, each part served the whole, and the whole gave service to the parts. … The living body of reality had its foundation in the material realm, and its culmination was in the splendor of the spirit. … [But now] the organism splits and disappears. We are left only [with the duality of] matter and spirit, the real and the ideal. The glory of the world is reduced to either one or the other. Thus transformed into a thin thread of ideas or an endless flux of causes and effects, the world becomes an illusion. And through idealism and materialization, mathematical calculus or atomic movement, it tends to dissolve into nothingness.

=== Text #40: Emil Cioran - The desire to be nothing ===
Author: Emil Cioran (1911-1995)
Title: The desire to be nothing
Tags: Nothingness, Pessimism, Solitude, Inner self, Fulfillment
Passage:
Once the shutters are closed, I stretch out in the dark. The outer world, a fading murmur, dissolves. All that is left is myself and … there’s the rub. Hermits have spent their lives in dialogue with what was most hidden within them. If only, following their example, I could give myself up to that extreme exercise, in which one unites with the intimacy of one’s own being! It is this self-interview, this inward transition which matters, and which has no value unless continually renewed, so that the self is finally absorbed by its essential version.
The faint light in each of us which dates back to before our birth, to before all births, is what must be protected if we want to rejoin that remote glory from which we shall never know why we were separated.
I have never known a single sensation of fulfillment, of true happiness, without thinking that it was the moment when – now or never – I should disappear for good.

=== Text #39: Juan Bautista Alberdi - Philosophy as Freedom ===
Author: Juan Bautista Alberdi (1810–1884)
Title: Philosophy as Freedom
Tags: Freedom, Reason, Philosophy, Emancipation, Progress
Passage:
Since philosophy is the denial of all authority other than the authority of reason, philosophy is the mother of all emancipation, of all freedom, of all social progress. … There is only one freedom – that of reason, which has as many phases as there are elements in the human spirit. So when all these freedoms, or phases of rational freedom, do not exist at the same time, it can be said that no freedom properly exists. … To be free is not merely to act according to reason, but also to think according to reason, to believe according to reason, to write according to reason, to see according to reason… If, then, we want to be free, let us first be worthy of it. Freedom does not come in a flash. It is the slow birth of civilization. Freedom is not the conquest of a day; it is one of the purposes of humanity, a purpose that it will never achieve except relatively.
