=== Text #27: Jean Paul Sartre - Existence before essence ===
Author: Jean Paul Sartre (1905-1980)
Title: Existence before essence
Tags: Existentialism, Freedom, Self-creation, Human nature, Authenticity, Responsibility
Passage:
"What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world—and defines himself afterwards. If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable, it is because to begin with he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself. Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be, but he is what he wills—and as he conceives himself after already existing—as he wills to be after that leap towards existence. Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism."

=== Text #28: John Sullivan Dwight - Music is of unity ===
Author: John Sullivan Dwight (1813-1893)
Title: Music is of unity
Tags: Music, Unity, Essence, Transcendence, Art, Spirituality, Inner world
Passage:
"Music does not express this or that particular joy, this or that sorrow, pain or devotion, or peace—but joy, sorrow, pain, devotion or peace themselves in their abstract essence: as perfect types and therefore as they exist in the mind of God and in the inner nature of things. ... Music reveals to us an unknown kingdom—a world that has nothing in common with the outer world of sense that surrounds us, and in which we leave behind all definite feelings to surrender ourselves to an inexpressible longing. ... In music we feel ourselves at home in a higher sphere; we are citizens of an ideal world where we find again our true selves—our deepest being—and where we are united with all who share this inner life."

=== Text #29: Aldus Huxley - The self as an island ===
Author: Aldus Huxley (1894-1963)
Title: The self as an island
Tags: Unity, Wholeness, Soul, Connection, Perennial Philosophy, Transcendence, Interconnectedness
Passage:
"We live in succession—in division—in parts—in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty—to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us—is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour—but also active like light—passing through us as if we were transparent—and making us see all things in its rays; a light which shines through us upon things and makes them beautiful. ... We are like islands in the sea—separate on the surface but connected in the deep."

=== Text #30: Jean-Jacques Rousseau - Virtue, freedom, love ===
Author: Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
Title: Virtue, freedom, love
Tags: Nature, Virtue, Freedom, Love, Self-love, Innocence, Education
Passage:
"The first impulses of nature are always right; there is no original sin in the human heart; every vice can be traced to its beginning step by step. ... The only passion natural to man is self-love—or selfishness taken in an extended sense. This selfishness considered relative to ourselves is good and useful; and since it has no necessary relation to others it becomes indifferent by nature: It becomes good or bad only by application and according to circumstances. ... Until reason's guide appears children should do nothing except by physical necessity: They should never obey someone else's will nor command others' will themselves."

=== Text #34: Simone Weil - To accept the void ===
Author: Simone Weil (1909-1943)
Title: To accept the void
Tags: Void, Emptiness, Detachment, Spirituality, God, Need, Acceptance
Passage:
"We must accept emptiness instead trying fill it up with imaginary satisfactions... We must not seek being but rather consent not‑to‑be... To detach ourselves from imaginary goods so real good may come... To wait patiently inactive while time passes leaving us empty until real inspiration comes... All sins are attempts fill voids... Each void presents itself as need... And every need tends toward its satisfaction unless we stop it voluntarily accepting void instead satisfaction thus transforming need into desire for absolute good which cannot be satisfied by anything finite but only by infinite reality itself namely God who alone can fill infinite abyss within human soul created for Him alone."
