Passage:
You call yourself free? I want to hear your dominating thought, not to hear that you have escaped from a yoke. Are you one of those who has the RIGHT to escape from a yoke? Some people threw away their last value when they threw away their servitude.

Free FROM what? That doesn’t matter to Zarathustra! But your eyes should tell me brightly: Free FOR what? Can you give yourself your own evil and your own good, and place your own will above yourself as a law? Can you be your own judge and punisher of your law? It is terrible to be alone with the judge and punisher of one’s own law. That is how a star is thrown out into the void and into the icy breath of solitude.

Title: Existence before essence
Source: Existentialist philosophy
[Tags: Existentialism, Freedom, Identity, Self‑definition, Human Nature]
Passage:
What do we mean by saying that EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE? We mean that the human being first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. The human being, as seen by the existentialist, cannot be defined because at first he is nothing. He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself.

… What we mean to say is that the human being has a greater dignity than a stone or a table. Because he first of all exists – he is something which pushes itself towards a future, and he is aware that this is what he is doing. A human being is, indeed, a project which has a subjective life, instead of being a kind of moss, or a fungus or a cauliflower.

Passage:
Only knowledge that relates to existence is essential knowledge. All knowledge which is not existential – which does not involve inward reflection – is really accidental knowledge. Its degree and scope are of no importance. … The highest point of inwardness in an existing person is passion, because passion corresponds to truth as a paradox [=unsupported by objective reason]. … By forgetting that we are existing subjects, we lose passion, and truth stops to be a paradox, but the knowing subject begins to lose his humanity and becomes fantastic.

… The objective accent is on WHAT is said; the subjective accent is on HOW it is said. … Only in subjectivity is there decision and commitment, so to seek it in objectivity is to be in error. The passion of infinity brings forth decisiveness, not its content. In this way, the subjective HOW and subjectivity are the truth.

Passage:
Just as the essence of matter is gravity, so, in contrast, we may affirm that the essence of Spirit is Freedom. Everybody will easily agree that Spirit also has, among other properties, Freedom; but philosophy teaches that all the qualities of Spirit exist only through Freedom; that all these qualities are only means for attaining Freedom; that all of them seek and produce this and only this. It is a result of speculative philosophy that freedom is the only truth of Spirit.

Matter possesses gravity because of its tendency toward a central point. It is essentially composite – consisting of parts that exclude each other. It seeks its unity … Spirit, in contrast, may be defined as that which has its center in itself. It does not have a unity outside itself, but it has already found it; it exists in and with itself. Matter has its essence out of itself; Spirit has self‑contained existence.

Title: The desire for wisdom

[Tags: Wisdom, Desire, Happiness, Truth, Philosophy]
Passage:
Just as it is agreed that we all wish to be happy, so too it is agreed that we all wish to be wise, because who is happy without wisdom? Because nobody is satisfied without the supreme good which is discovered and possessed in the truth which we call wisdom.

Even before we are happy, the idea of happiness is impressed on our mind. This is how we know, and can assert confidently and with no doubt whatsoever, that we wish to be happy. Similarly, even before we are wise, the notion of wisdom is stamped on our mind. That is why each of us, if asked whether he wants to be wise, replies without a shadow of doubt that he does. … Because if your mind was not somehow aware of what wisdom is, you would never know that you desire to be wise, or that you should desire to be wise – and neither of them, I think, you will deny.

Title: The guiding principle
Source: Meditations
[Tags: Stoicism, Inner Freedom, Guiding Principle, Self‑discipline]
Passage:
2:9. You must always bear in mind what is the nature of the whole cosmos, and what is my own nature, and how the first is related to the second, and what kind of a part I am in the whole. And there is nobody who stops you from always doing and saying the things that are according to the nature of the whole, of which you are a part.

7:28. Retire into yourself. The rational principle which rules is by nature content with itself when it does what is just, and in doing so it achieves tranquility.

8:48. Remember that the guiding principle is invincible. When it is self‑collected, it is satisfied with itself, if it does nothing which it does not choose to do. … Therefore, the mind which is free from passions is a citadel, because a person has nothing more secure to which he can escape.
