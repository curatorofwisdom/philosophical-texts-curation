Passage:
"To love spiritually is to feel compassion, and whoever feels most compassionate loves most. People who burn with charity towards their fellow human beings feel this way because they have understood the depths of their own misery, of their own lack of substance, their own nothingness. And then, after turning their opened eyes towards their fellow human beings, they see that these people too are equally miserable, subject to annihilation, and they feel for them compassion and love.  from this love or compassion for yourself, from this intense despair, from knowledge that you will not exist after you die just as you did not exist before your birth, you go on to feel compassion for  that is, love to  all your fellow human beings in this world appearance those miserable shadows who walk about going from nothingness nothingness mere sparks consciousness shining moment infinite eternal darkness."

Passage:
"Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being descends into us from we know not where.  I am forced every moment to acknowledge a higher origin of events than the will which I call mine. As with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch that flowing river which, out of regions I dont see, pours for a while its streams into me, I see that I am a pensioner  not a cause, but a surprised spectator of this ethereal water; that I may desire and search and be receptive, but from some alien energy the visions come.  We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime, within each person is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty; to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE."

=== Text #18: George Santayana - Beauty as perfection ===
Author: George Santayana (1863-1952)
Title: Beauty as perfection
Tags: Beauty, Perfection, Harmony, Soul, Nature, Morality, Aesthetics
Passage:
"Our mind is satisfied when it finds harmony between who we are and what we experience: It finds it in the experience of beauty. When our perceptions and our imagination find what they crave  so that the correspondence between them is perfect, then perception is pleasure and existence needs no apology. The duality which is the condition of conflict disappears Beauty therefore seems to be the clearest manifestation of perfection, and the best evidence of its possibility. If perfection is, as it should be, the ultimate justification of being, we may understand the moral dignity of beauty. Beauty is a testimony of the possible agreement between the soul and nature, and consequently a reason for faith in the supremacy of the good."

=== Text #19: Aristotle - Happiness and virtue ===
Author: Aristotle (384	6322 BC)
Title: Happiness and virtue
Tags: Happiness, Virtue, Pleasure, Goodness, Flourishing, Eudaimonia, Ethics
Passage:
"Pleasure belongs to the soul, and pleasure for each person is about what he is a lover of: Horses for horse-lovers, and plays for theater-lovers, and in the same way justice is pleasant for a person who loves justice. And, in general, things that conform with virtue are pleasant for those who love virtue. Now, the pleasures of most people are in conflict with each other, because they are not pleasant by their nature. But the lovers of goodness take pleasure in things that are pleasant by their nature. Such are always actions in conformity to virtue, so they are pleasant in themselves to lovers of goodness. The life of these people does not need extra pleasure as an additional attraction, because it contains its pleasure in itself But if so, then virtuous actions must be pleasant in themselves. But they are also good and noble. And they are good and noble in the highest degree, since the good person makes good judgements about these things. Happiness, then, is the best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world."
