Passage:
The human being lives in a symbolic universe. Language, myth, art, and religion are parts of this universe. They are the various threads which weave the symbolic net, the tangled web of human experience. All human progress in thought and experience is based on refining and strengthening this net.

No longer can the human being confront reality immediately; he cannot see it face to face. Physical reality seems to recede the more human symbolic activity advances. Instead of dealing with the things themselves, the human being is, in a sense, constantly conversing with himself. He has enveloped himself so much in linguistic forms, in artistic images, in mythical symbols or religious rites that he cannot see or know anything except through this artificial medium.
