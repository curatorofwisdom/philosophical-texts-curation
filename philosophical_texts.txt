=== Text #14: Epictetus - ENCHIRIDION ===
Author: Epictetus (55-135 AD)
Title: ENCHIRIDION (135 AD)
Tags: Stoicism, Acceptance, Duty, Role-playing, Moderation, Fate
Passage:
**15.** *Remember that you must behave in life like at a dinner party. Is a dish brought to you? Put out your hand and take your share with moderation. Does it pass away from you? Don’t stop it. Has it not arrived yet? Don’t stretch your hand, but wait until it reaches you. Do this regarding children, wife, public posts, riches, and you will eventually be a worthy participant in the feasts of the gods*.
**17.** *Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of whatever kind the author wished to make it. If it is short, then short; if it is long, then long. If he wishes you to act the role of a poor man, or a cripple, or a governor, or a private person, make sure that you act it properly. Because this is your task, to act well the character that was assigned you. To choose your part is somebody else’s business*.

=== Text #13: Michel de Montaigne - Solitude ===
Author: Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592)
Title: ESSAYS, Book 1, Chapter 39: “Solitude”
Tags: Solitude, Self, Freedom, Inner chains, Mind, Isolation
Passage:
*It is not enough to get away from the public, and not enough to go to another place. We have to get away from the conditions of the public that are inside us. It is our own self that we have to isolate and possess again.*
*(“I have broken my chain,” you say. But a dog may break its chain and still carry a long part of it connected to its neck” – Persius)*
*We carry our chains with us. Our freedom is not total. We still look at the things we have left behind. Our imagination is still full of them. … Our disease lies in the mind, and it cannot escape from itself.* *(“The mind which never escapes from itself is at fault” – Horace)*
*So we must bring back the mind and drag it into itself. That is the true solitude. It can be enjoyed in towns and in kings’ courts, but more conveniently alone.*

=== Text #12: Novalis - LOGICAL FRAGMENTS I:25 ===
Author: Novalis (1772–1801)
Title: LOGICAL FRAGMENTS I:25
Tags: Poetry, Philosophy, Unity, Whole, Romanticism, Sympathy
Passage:
*Poetry elevates each single thing through a particular combination with the rest of the whole. And while philosophy prepares the world for the active influence of ideas, poetry is the key to philosophy – to its purpose and meaning. Because poetry shapes the beautiful society, the world-family, the beautiful home of the universe.*
*Philosophy strengthens the powers of the individual with the powers of humanity and the universe, through system and state, making the whole the instrument of the individual, and the individual the instrument of the whole. In the same way, poetry functions regarding life: The individual lives in the whole and the whole in the individual. Through poetry there arises the highest sympathy and common activity, the most intimate communion of the finite and the infinite.*

=== Text #11: Willem Zuurdeeg - MAN BEFORE CHAOS ===
Author: Willem Zuurdeeg (1906–1963)
Title: MAN BEFORE CHAOS
Tags: Philosophy as cry, Authenticity, Awakening, Passion, Meaning, God
Passage:
*Philosophy is born in a cry. The fountain of philosophizing is not cold, abstract intellectualizing, but a deep and passionate concern about life and its meaning. … Plato’s birth as a philosopher came when he cried out loud: “Being MUST prevail over meaninglessness and death!” …*
*The philosophical crying out suggests that a person can become authentically human when he has cried out in anxiety and triumph, in angry rebellion and in joyful reverence. Someone or some event touches him in a vital way, hurts him, knocks him over. When this happens, the cover is removed from a deeper, fuller possibility of his being. A self which had been trapped, or is sleeping, is liberated or awakened. Through such crying out, the person can become more truly himself, reaching out toward fulfilled humanity by establishing a fuller relationship to his own being, to others, to his world, and to his God.*

=== Text #10: Gabriel Marcel - MYSTERY OF BEING ===
Author: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973)
Title: MYSTERY OF BEING (1951)
Tags: Generosity, Light, Giving, Spirituality, Existence, Illumination
Passage:
*To give is to expand, to expand oneself. But we must be careful not to interpret this in a material way, as if something that is too full flows out. The soul of the gift is its generosity, and obviously generosity is a virtue which must be carefully distinguished from excess. Wouldn’t an accurate definition of generosity be: A LIGHT WHOSE JOY IS TO GIVE LIGHT, TO BE LIGHT? …*
*The special property of light is that it illuminates, it illuminates for others. This goes beyond the distinction between for me and for others. We might even say that this distinction does not exist for the light. If the joy of light is to be light, then it can only wish to be always more so. Light knows itself, then, as illuminating; and this knowledge is not like a sense of weakening and wasting itself, but on the contrary – it helps to increase its power. Like fire, generosity nurtures itself.*
