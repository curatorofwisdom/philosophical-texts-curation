Author: Gabriel Marcel (1889-1973)
Title: Myself as a gift
Tags: Gift, Self, Ego, Humility, Responsibility
Passage:
Maybe there is no more fatal error than that which conceives of the ego as the secret home of originality. … The best part of my personality does not belong to me. I am in no sense the owner, only the trustee. … If I consider myself as the guardians of my gifts, responsible for their fruitfulness – that is to say, if I recognize in them a call, or perhaps a question to which I must respond – it will not occur to me to be proud about them, and to parade them before an audience, which (as I said before) really means before myself.
Indeed, if we think about it, there is nothing in me that cannot or should not be regarded as a gift. It is pure fiction to imagine a pre-existent self to whom those gifts were given thanks to certain rights that I have, or as a reward for my previous merits.
